# Respiratory Disease Classification


## Project status


## Introduction
The breathing sound test is a telemedical online lung auscultation that automatically returns the probability of having healthy airways. A probability <70% is an indication for consulting a physician. In case of risk factors or symptoms, further testing is recommended at even higher probabilities.

## Motivation
[Seven percent of the world population](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30157-0/fulltext) suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, predominately COPD. In 2017, they caused 3.9 million deaths and even more disabilities. Before COVID19, the one-year global incidence of acute respiratory diseases was already near to 100%. COPD is the third and lower respiratory infections the fourth [global leading cause of death](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death).

Telehealth reduces the burden on medical resources, saves the patientsÂ´ time and money, and is easily accessible regardless of the location. Telemedical care [increased during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532385/). The [evolution of convolutional neural networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156454) further contribute to this increase.

## Software build
### Build with Python
#### Preprocessing and Augmentation
#### Convolutional Neural Network
#### Supported Vector Machine
### Build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
#### HTML and CSS
The full web application includes:
- during the initial state:
  - a train button with instructions for a better auscultation, an animation and a respiratory audio sample
  - a more button leading to this readme file
  - a contact button leading to the GitHub accounts of the members of this project
  - a scroll menu to indicate if users are uncertain about their health status, certain to be health or know about a respiratory disease
  - a button to start the recording
- during the return state after the 16-seconds recording phase
  - the probability of having health airways with and without smoking
  - a threshold below which consulting a physician is recommended
  - a table with possibilities to further improve the recording quality
#### Javascript
In addition to run the functions just listed, the script
  - gets access to the usersÂ´s microphone
  - updates the scroll menu to offer further options if the users state having diseased airways
